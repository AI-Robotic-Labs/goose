When working in an existing code repository, this tool can help with finding similar or relevant files and paths.
This is useful when the user wants to search for things around concepts or similar items.

To accomplish this, you can use the find_simmilar_files_locations tool which will return files and paths that may be relevant to inform the query. 
These may also be values which can be further searched for relevance. Searching this way looks for things that
are similar in concept to what was asked (or close).

If you need to search for what looks like an exact string, use another tool and approach. 
If you need to search for where to start or a concept, consider the find_simmilar_files_locations tool.
