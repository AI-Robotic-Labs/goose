# Plan for Transforming Goose into a MemGPT Model

The goal is to enhance the existing **Goose** system by integrating memory management capabilities inspired by **MemGPT**. This will allow Goose to handle extended contexts by shuffling information in and out of the LLM's context window and storing/retrieving data from external memory. Below is a detailed plan outlining the steps and the corresponding components that need to be coded.

---

## 1. Analyze Existing Goose Architecture

**Objective**: Understand the current structure of Goose to identify integration points for the new memory management features.

**Actions**:

- **Review Key Components**:
  - **Exchange Mechanism**: How messages and context are managed.
  - **Toolkit System**: How tools are defined, loaded, and used by the LLM.
  - **Message Handling**: Storage and retrieval of conversation history.

---

## 2. Design the Memory Management System

**Objective**: Architect a memory hierarchy within Goose to manage the LLM's context effectively.

**Components to Design**:

- **Memory Hierarchy**:
  - **Main Context (RAM)**: Active messages within the LLM's context window.
  - **External Memory (Disk/Database)**: Stored messages or data outside the context window.

- **Memory Operations**:
  - **Paging Mechanism**: Methods to move data between main context and external memory.
  - **Context Summarization**: Summarize less relevant information to save context space.
  - **Context Retrieval**: Efficiently load necessary information back into the context.

---

## 3. Implement the MemoryManager Class

**Objective**: Create a central class to handle memory operations.

**Files to Create/Modify**:

- **`src/goose/memory_manager.py`**: New module for the `MemoryManager` class.

**Responsibilities of MemoryManager**:

- **Store and Retrieve Data**: Provide methods to read from and write to external memory.
- **Manage Addresses**: Handle memory addresses or keys for stored data.
- **Interface with External Storage**: Abstract storage details (e.g., file system, database).

**Methods to Implement**:

- `write(data: Any) -> str`: Stores data and returns a memory address.
- `read(address: str) -> Any`: Retrieves data from a memory address.
- `list_addresses() -> List[str]`: Lists all stored memory addresses.
- `delete(address: str)`: Removes data from a memory address.

---

## 4. Develop New Tools for Memory Management

**Objective**: Provide the LLM with tools to interact with the MemoryManager.

**Files to Create/Modify**:

- **`src/goose/toolkit/memory.py`**: New toolkit module for memory tools.

**Tools to Implement**:

1. **`read_memory(address: str) -> Any`**:
   - Reads data from external memory.
   - Returns the data to the LLM.

2. **`write_memory(data: Any) -> str`**:
   - Writes data to external memory.
   - Returns the memory address.

3. **`summarize_context() -> str`**:
   - Summarizes current context/messages.
   - Stores the summary in external memory.
   - Returns the memory address of the summary.

4. **`load_context(address: str)`**:
   - Loads data from external memory into the main context.
   - Updates the LLM's current context.

5. **`list_memory() -> List[str]`**:
   - Lists available memory addresses.
   - Helps the LLM decide what data to retrieve.

**Integration**:

- Ensure these tools are registered in the toolkit system and accessible to the LLM.

## 5. Extend the Exchange Class to Support Dynamic Context

**Objective**: Modify the Exchange class to handle context adjustments and interact with the MemoryManager.

**Files to Modify**:

- **`src/goose/exchange.py`** (or equivalent module):

**Modifications**:

- **Context Management Methods**:
  - Implement methods to summarize, truncate, and restore context.
  - Interact with MemoryManager to store and retrieve summarized context.

- **Message Handling Adjustments**:
  - Update message storage to allow for context swapping.
  - Ensure message IDs and references remain consistent when context changes.

- **Integration with Memory Tools**:
  - Facilitate communication between the Exchange and the memory tools.
  - Allow the LLM to invoke memory operations seamlessly during exchanges.

---

## 6. Implement Event-Driven Control Flow

**Objective**: Adjust the system to process messages as events, enabling dynamic interaction without fixed user prompts.

**Actions**:

- **Rework Message Processing Loop**:
  - Modify the main interaction loop to handle events/messages dynamically.
  - Implement an event queue or dispatcher if necessary.

- **Asynchronous Handling** (Optional):
  - Consider using async programming to handle events concurrently.
  - Ensure thread safety and data consistency.

**Files to Modify**:

- **`src/goose/cli/session.py`**:
  - Update the session handling to support event-driven interactions.

---

## 7. Update System Prompts and Policies

**Objective**: Guide the LLM to utilize the new memory management tools effectively.

**Files to Modify**:

- **System Prompt Templates**:
  - **`prompts/system.jinja`** (or relevant prompt files).

**Modifications**:

- **Introduce Memory Operations**:
  - Explain the available memory tools in the system prompt.
  - Provide examples of when and how to use them.

- **Encourage Efficient Memory Use**:
  - Instruct the LLM to summarize and store less relevant information.
  - Suggest strategies for retrieving necessary context.

---

## 8. Ensure Compliance with MemGPT Design Principles

**Objective**: Align the implementation with the key features outlined in the MemGPT paper.

**Actions**:

- **Review MemGPT Features**:
  - Memory hierarchy.
  - Function calls for memory operations.
  - Event-driven control flow.

- **Compare Implementations**:
  - Ensure all MemGPT capabilities are reflected in the Goose enhancements.
  - Adjust designs where discrepancies are found.

---

## 9. Conduct Testing and Evaluation

**Objective**: Validate the new features and assess their performance.

**Files to Create**:

- **Test Scripts and Cases**:
  - **`tests/test_memory_management.py`**:
    - Unit tests for MemoryManager methods.
    - Integration tests for memory tools within the LLM interactions.

**Testing Scenarios**:

- **Long Conversations**:
  - Test the LLM's ability to maintain context over extended dialogues.
  - Verify that older context is correctly stored and retrieved.

- **Document Analysis**:
  - Assess the LLM's capability to summarize and analyze large documents.
  - Evaluate the retrieval of relevant information from external memory.

- **Stress Testing**:
  - Push the limits of context size and observe memory management behavior.

---

## 10. Update Documentation and Examples

**Objective**: Provide clear guidelines on the new features for users and developers.

**Files to Create/Modify**:

- **`README.md`**:
  - Update with an overview of memory management features.

- **`docs/memory_management.md`**:
  - Detailed explanation of the memory hierarchy and tools.
  - Usage examples and best practices.

- **`examples/memory_management_example.py`**:
  - Sample script demonstrating how to use the new memory tools.
